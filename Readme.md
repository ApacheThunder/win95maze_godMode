GodMode Version: This version HP system removed.

Old web source for a recreation of the Windows 95 3D Maze screen saver created by sirtophatte.

This is similar to https://github.com/ibid-11962/Windows-95-3D-Maze-Screensaver however unlike that one you can control where to go in the maze.

However this one is much older then that one so it may not work in newer versions of browsers. Try testing it in older versions of Firefox.
At one point in older versions of Firefox I was able to run this locally.

I did not make this. Someone by the name of sirtophatte is mentioned in the html who is believed to have created this.

I recovered this from the web archive, fixed it up and will put it here for posterity. I've tried contacting him to let him know of this but never got a response.

Notable change I've made is some of the images like the happy face and rat images.
Since the 3DMaze source was accessible via Win NT source code I was able to retrieve some of the original assets it used like the happy face used to end
the maze.

I also made changes to the resolution of the rat image so it looks more correct to the original. Don't ask me why the rats hurt you in this minigame.
You can blame the original auther for that. I've also reorganized the location of the JS files and image assets so it all makes more sense. :P


I've enabled pages so you can view a live copy of this. It appears to work in latest Firefox at least:

https://ApacheThunder.github.io/win95maze/

Use this URL if you want to play without the rats harming you:

You can use arrow keys to control where you go. I've forgotten if there was any other key commands. :P
